## Project Overview: Covid 19 spread across the world
- I analyzed global COVID-19 data to explore the spread, impact, and trends of the pandemic across countries and regions. Using publicly available datasets (e.g. WHO data, Kaggle COVID-19 datasets), I applied data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to uncover key insights.

Objective : 
- Analyze cases, deaths, and recovery trends at country and regional levels

- Identify countries/regions with the highest mortality rates

- Compare pandemic progression across WHO regions

- Visualize  trends to highlight peaks and waves
 
Tools Used : Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau



### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Standardizing Data
- Headers Naming Convention
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.



### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
- Analyze cases, deaths, and recovery trends at country and regional levels

- Identify countries/regions with the highest mortality rates

- Compare pandemic progression across WHO regions

- Visualized trends to highlight peaks and waves



### Data Analysis using SQL
```sql
-- Simply retrieving data from the table
SELECT * FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest LIMIT 1000;
