## Project Overview: Covid 19 spread across the world
- I analyzed global COVID-19 data to explore the spread, impact, and trends of the pandemic across countries and regions. Using publicly available datasets (e.g. WHO data, Kaggle COVID-19 datasets), I applied data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to uncover key insights.

Objective : 
- Analyze cases, deaths, and recovery trends at country and regional levels

- Identify countries/regions with the highest mortality rates

- Compare pandemic progression across WHO regions

- Visualize  trends to highlight peaks and waves
 
Tools Used : Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau



### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Standardizing Data
- Headers Naming Convention
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.



### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
- Analyze cases, deaths, and recovery trends at country and regional levels

- Identify countries/regions with the highest mortality rates

- Compare pandemic progression across WHO regions

- Visualized trends to highlight peaks and waves



### Data Analysis using SQL
```sql
-- Simply retrieving data from the table
SELECT * FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest LIMIT 1000;
```
```sql
-- Listing out the countries with most deaths in each WHO Region
SELECT WHO_Region, Country, Deaths
FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest AS main
WHERE Deaths = (
  SELECT MAX(Deaths)
  FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest AS sub
  WHERE sub.WHO_Region = main.WHO_Region
)
ORDER BY Deaths;
```
```sql
-- Listing out the countries with most people recovered in each WHO Region
SELECT WHO_Region, Country, Recovered
FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest AS main
WHERE Recovered = (
  SELECT MAX(Recovered)
  FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest AS sub
  WHERE sub.WHO_Region = main.WHO_Region
)
ORDER BY Recovered;
```
```sql
-- Listing out the WHO Region  with most deaths,recovered and confirmed across the world
SELECT * FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest 
order by Country;
SELECT 
  WHO_Region,
  SUM(Deaths) AS Total_Deaths,
  SUM(Confirmed) AS Total_Confirmed,
  SUM(Recovered) AS Total_Recovered
FROM 
  covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest
GROUP BY 
  WHO_Region
ORDER BY 
  Total_Deaths DESC;
```









```sql
-- Highest recovery rate around the world in different WHO region
SELECT 
  WHO_Region,
  ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(Recovered), SUM(Confirmed)) * 100, 2) AS Recovery_Rate_Percent
FROM 
  covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest
GROUP BY 
  WHO_Region
ORDER BY 
  Recovery_Rate_Percent DESC;
```


```sql
-- Highest Death rate around the world in different WHO region
SELECT 
  WHO_Region,
  SUM(Deaths) AS Total_Deaths,
  SUM(Confirmed) AS Total_Confirmed,
  ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(Deaths), SUM(Confirmed)) * 100, 2) AS Death_Rate_Percent
FROM 
  covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest
GROUP BY 
  WHO_Region
ORDER BY 
  Death_Rate_PercentÂ DESC;
```


```sql
-- Countries which didn't reported any deaths during this timeframe
 SELECT Country, Confirmed, Deaths,WHO_Region
FROM covid-analysis-463108.Covid_19_Analysis.Country_Wise_Latest
WHERE Deaths = 0 AND Confirmed > 0
ORDER BY Confirmed DESC
limit 10;
```











## COVID-19 Data Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Key Questions Addressed
- How did COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries vary across countries and WHO regions?
- Which countries and regions experienced the highest mortality rates?
- What trends emerged over time in the spread of the virus?

  
ðŸ”¹ Findings Summary
- The highest death counts were concentrated in specific regions (e.g. Americas, Europe), while mortality rates varied significantly by country.
- The progression of cases and deaths showed distinct waves globally, with peaks at different times across regions.
- Some countries had disproportionately high case fatality rates, highlighting differences in healthcare capacity and response.


 
ðŸ”¹ Recommendations
- Use regional trends to inform preparedness and resource allocation for future outbreaks.
- Strengthen data reporting consistency to enable more accurate cross-country comparisons.
- Apply similar analytical frameworks for monitoring future pandemics or public health crises.
